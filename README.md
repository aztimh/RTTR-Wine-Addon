NEW BUILDINGS

1. VINEYARD
- Castle: 4 Boards, 4 Stones
- "The winegrower plants and harvests grapes in the surrounding fields. A vineyard requires a steady supply of sturdy logs for trellises and fresh water to irrigate the fields. Ripe grapes are sent to the winery to be pressed into wine."
- Worker/Tool: Winegrower/Shovel
- Goods in: Wood and Water
- Goods out: Grapes
- Work Sound: Digging/Forester (Sound 76)
- Default distribution of goods: Wood (20%), Water (20%)

2. WINERY
- House: 2 Boards, 3 Stones
- "At the winery, grapes are stomped in a vat to produce wine. The vintner's wine is of high quality, worthy of sacrifice at the temple."
- Worker/Tool: Vintner/No Tool
- Goods in: Grapes
- Goods out: Wine
- Work Sound: Rowing Boat (sound 81) OR Sound 73?

3. TEMPLE
- Castle: 4 Boards, 7 Stones
- "The temple servant sacrifices wine and food granting a blessing of gold, iron ore, coal or granite. This allows your iron founder and minter to continue working when mines become exhausted. The desired mineral can be selected by toggling the output button."
- Worker/Tool: Temple Servant/Crucible
- Goods in: Wine and Food
- Goods out: Gold/Iron Ore/Coal/Stone
- Default Output setting: Random (Gold/Iron Ore/Coal/Stones: 25% chance each), OR you can choose a guaranteed mineral: Iron Ore, Coal, Stone to produce. Each option has the corresponding ICON: a wildcard of all 4 minerals or Iron Ore/Coal/Stone for the individual ones. To produce gold you must leave it on random, so it can only ever be a slow source of renewable gold as it will also produce iron ore, coal and stone in equal amounts.
- Work Sound: Burning (Sound 93)
- Default distribution of goods: Foodstuff (80%)



GENERAL OVERVIEW:

The function of the wine addon is to add a new supplementary economic chain which works alongside the existing economy to provide a renewable source of mine minerals: Gold, Iron Ore, Coal and Stone. This is most effective on maps with lots of farming space. It is more useful when mines are set to exhaustible.

This is balanced by the number of buildings and space required and their cost. The required wares to generate them also discourages investing in this chain too early. As the Temple requires food the same as mines and the new wine resource you cannot skip the normal economic buildings required for production.

On maps with limited Iron/Gold deposits you can now find extra value in occupying open farming space to set up vineyard wine economy to gain extra minerals from temples. Renewable gold production is balanced by only being able to be produced at random 25% of the time from a temple. This means for more gold to be produced you will need multiple temples supported by wine and food production. You can however alter the Temple to either produce: random (gold/iron ore/coal/stone: 25% chance for each), iron ore (100%), coal (100%) or stone (100%).

It doesn't compete directly with the charburner. Although both can produce coal: the charburner can do so on beach/desert terrain and is only a single building required in order to produce coal.
